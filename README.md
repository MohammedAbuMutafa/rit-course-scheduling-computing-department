## Visualizations

### Course Schedule Overview
![Course Schedule Visualization](idea1.png)
*Comprehensive course schedule showing all classes across different days and time slots. Each colored bar represents a different course with room assignments and time blocks.*

### Instructor Schedule Example
![Instructor Schedule](idea2.png)
*Individual instructor schedule showing Omar Abdul Latif's weekly course load with specific room assignments and time slots.*

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Required Python Packages
Install the following packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install pygad
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install openpyxl
pip install xlrd
```

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohammedAbuMutafa/rit-course-scheduling-computing-department.git
   cd rit-course-scheduling-computing-department
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

### 1. Clean Excel File
- Select "Clean Excel File" from the main menu
- Choose your Excel file containing course data
- Select the appropriate sheet (e.g., "Spring 2024", "Fall 2024")
- The system will clean and process the data automatically

### 2. Generate Course Schedule
- Select "Generate Course Schedule"
- Enter the number of generations for the genetic algorithm
- Select Spring and Fall CSV files (cleaned data)
- Click "OK" to start the optimization process
- Monitor progress with the visual progress bar

### 3. Visualize Schedules
- **Classroom Visualizer**: View overall course distribution across rooms and time slots
- **Instructor Visualizer**: Analyze individual instructor schedules and workloads

## Algorithm Details

### Genetic Algorithm Parameters
- **Population Size**: Configurable based on problem complexity
- **Generations**: User-defined for optimization depth
- **Fitness Function**: Considers multiple factors:
  - Classroom capacity constraints
  - Time conflict avoidance
  - Instructor availability
  - Course prerequisite satisfaction

### Constraint Handling
- **Hard Constraints**: Must be satisfied (classroom capacity, time conflicts)
- **Soft Constraints**: Optimized for (instructor preferences, room types)
- **Penalty System**: Automatic conflict detection and resolution

## Data Format

### Input Data Structure
The system expects Excel files with the following columns:
- `Subject`: Course subject code (e.g., CSEC, NSSA, ISTE)
- `Cat#`: Course catalog number
- `Sect#`: Section number

- `Days`: Meeting days (M, T, W, R, F)
- `Time Start`: Course start time
- `Time End`: Course end time
- `Room #`: Assigned classroom
- `Enrollment`: Number of enrolled students

### Classroom Data
```csv
classroom, capacity, type, department
D207, 30, B, computing
D018, 24, L, computing
H306, 40, A, computing
```

### Prerequisites Data
```csv
